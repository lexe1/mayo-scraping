Hello,

I need to scrap all the Diseases and Conditions in the list here: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/index?letter=A

We need A-Z including #.

Per page we need to scrap the Symptoms list, Causes, Risk factors.

Only the titles in the list.



Then you need to take the Disease name and search it in the website https://www.icd10data.com/ and serach the disease name with "" for example "Abdominal aortic aneurysm". It will give you a list - I need you to take only the 
ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code. For example, I71.3.


For example, I took Abdominal aortic aneurysm
https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20350688

and I put it in the attached excel file.
This is the needed format. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
